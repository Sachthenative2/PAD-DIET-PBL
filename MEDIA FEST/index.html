                                    In Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697 (1931), the Supreme Court determined that <b>it is unconstitutional to exercise prior restraint with regard to print publications</b>: "It is plain, then, that the language of this amendment imports no more than that every man shall have a right to speak, write, and print his opinions upon any subject whatsoever, without any prior restraint, so always that he does not injure any other person in his rights, person, property, or reputation, and so always that he does not thereby disturb the public peace or attempt to subvert the government. It is neither more nor less than an expansion of the great doctrine recently brought into operation in the law of libel, that every man shall be at liberty to publish what is true, with good motives and for justifiable ends. And, with this reasonable limitation, it is not only right in itself, but it is an inestimable privilege in a free government."

                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                <p class="col s12 offset-s.5">
                    Think about a library that claims to have books about sports, but when you go there, all they have are books about soccer. Or how about a fruit market that only sells apples? What if all the fruit markets only sold apples because all the fruit markets were owned by the same company? Should libraries limit sports books to soccer? Should fruit markets only sell apples? Should all fruit markets be owned by the same company? Of course not; and just like we want the free flow of books and fruit, we also want the free flow of information, especially on the internet. The Constitution prohibits Congress from making a law that prohibits free speech and free press. But does a private company, like Google, have a right to prohibit free speech, or does Google have an obligation to the public to provide a forum that is free from censorship?

                <h5>Background</h5>
                <p class="col s12 offset-s.5">
                    Google is the most used search engine, accounting for about 75% of all internet searches (NetApplications, 2018). Users can search for information on almost any topic. YouTube, which is owned by Google, accounts for almost 80% of multimedia and video site visits (Statista, 2016). Based on their market dominance, Google/YouTube are in a position to control distribution of information and media.
                    <br /><br />
                    Google/YouTube uses algorithms that are designed to help users find the most likely answer for their search (Google). A problem arises, though, when Google/YouTube software developers allow their own bias to influence search results. A big issue right now is the claim that Google/YouTube is using its market dominance to stifle conservative viewpoints. “When Google's employees or algorithms decide to block our access to information about a news item, political candidate or business, opinions and votes can shift, reputations can be ruined and businesses can crash and burn” (Epstein, 2016).
                    <br /><br />
                    This issue is working its way through the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in the case of Prager University against Google and YouTube. Prager University makes educational videos that are mostly seen on YouTube, but lately, some of their videos have either been removed or have been demonetized. Prager University argues that the only reason their videos have been removed or demonetized is because of unlawful censorship.

                <h5>Thesis</h5>
                <p class="col s12 offset-s.5">
                    Google, which has monopolistic market control, should not censor free speech by restricting content because people should be able to hear both sides of an argument so that they can make up their own minds, Google should not infringe on the right of people making money using Google’s open-ended platform, and Google is dishonest about their bias.

                <h5>Recommendations</h5>
                <p class="col s12 offset-s.5">
                    Because Google/YouTube has a monopoly on search engines for information and multimedia, they should not censor free speech through their algorithms or otherwise. Further, Google should say if they are censoring websites and videos with full transparency. If Google/YouTube censors content in the future, they should provide an unambiguous statement on why the content was restricted. Freedom of speech, including the right to publish on the internet, is a foundation to a free society.
