                        Inside the Paleo Diet you can find all the differen macromolecules including lipids. This may seem to be a bad thing, having lipids, but some lipids are essential to the human body in helping give the body long term energy. The different carbs that can be found in the Paleo Diet are fiber but since there is a drop in carbohydrates there won't be much glucose or other different molecules. As for proteins there is a larger amount of those in the foods eaten through the Paleo Diet. Protein is the primary piece of the Paleo Diet. Lipids are also quite reduced, although since meats do have lipids they are substantial. Finally you can find Nucleic Acids in all the foods throughout the diet as in oranges and other citric acid foods. These are the different macromolecules found inside the food of all the different acceptable foods such as meats and vegitables that could be easily found.
